Snake Game in Java
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing for graphical user interface (GUI). The game features a snake that the player controls using arrow keys, with the goal of collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself. The player can restart the game after a "Game Over" by pressing the R key.

Key Features:
Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions (Left, Right, Up, Down) using the arrow keys. The snake's body grows each time it eats food.
Random Food Generation: Food is generated at random positions on the game grid. The snake eats the food to grow in size.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's body. A collision results in a "Game Over."
Game Over & Restart: When the snake collides with itself or the wall, the game stops and displays a "Game Over" message. The player can restart the game by pressing R.
Smooth Animation: The game is rendered at regular intervals, making the movement and updates of the game state smooth and responsive.

Technologies Used:
Java: The game is developed using Java programming language.
Swing: Java's Swing library is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components and rendering the game.
Controls:
Arrow Keys: Control the direction of the snake.
R: Restart the game after "Game Over."

How to Play:
1)Run the program to launch the Snake Game.
2)Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
3)Collect food to grow the snake while avoiding the walls and your own tail.
4)If you collide with the wall or the snake's body, the game ends. Press R to restart.
